## Sample Rails API

I'm using it to learn about:

* rails-api
* rspec_api_documentation
* active_model_serializers
* Apitome api docs

### Other things I plan to use this app to learn more about:

* Slate api docs theme
* API authentication methods

### Eventually plan to make some mobile clients

# What it actually does

It's a habit streak tracker similar to [Habit Streak][1]
